# Manchester-city

This is one of my first development projects. As part of a pilot Web Development program at my High School, I build a website based upon my
favorite soccer team, Manchester City. 
# Pages:
* Home: Introduction to website, contains brief intro message and two navigation bars
* Stats: Contains stats for offense, defense and discipline. These stats include goals, saves, and yellow/red cards.
* Roster: Displays the starting XI and top reserves. 
* Titles: Shows the years Manchester City won the FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, and Primer League.
* Photo Gallery: Small gallery of cool photos.
* Favorite Player?: Presents the user with a short list of my personal favorite players. Users can choose their favorite of my favorites. Users see what percentage of other users choose the player they choose. 
* Extras and Social Media: Drop down containing a photo gallery, short interactive survey, and social media streams (Twitter, FB).

# Technologies:
* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some SCSS/SASS.
* Database: Google Cloud Platform's Firebase Firestore NoSQL DB
